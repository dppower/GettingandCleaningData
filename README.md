## Instructions for use of the contents in this repository  
  
This repository contains:

* An R script called 'run_analysis.R'
  
* A 'complete' text file, which is the complete and tidied dataset, properly  
  labelled, this is in 'csv' format and can be read into R/RStudio with read.csv().
  
* A 'summary' text file, which is derived from the 'complete' dataset and is the  
  means of the measurement variables summarised by subject and activity. This is  
  also in 'csv' format.  
  
* A 'Codebook' text file describing the data.  
  
  
Download and unzip the data from the following URL:  
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  
  
Set the unzipped folder 'UCI HAR Dataset' as working directory. The R script can then be run in R/RStudio.  
This script will produce the 'complete' and 'summary' datasets and save both of them as  
comma-separated text files in working directory.
