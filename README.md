## Instructions for use of the contents in this repository  
  
This repository contains:

* An R script called 'run_analysis.R'
  
* A folder called 'data' that contains the individual data files that were used.
  
* A 'complete' text file, which is the complete and tidied dataset, properly  
  labelled, this is in 'csv' format and can be read into R/RStudio with read.csv().
  
* A 'summary' text file, which is derived from the 'complete' dataset and is the  
  means of the measurement variables summarised by subject and activity. This is  
  also in 'csv' format.  
  
* A 'Codebook' text file describing the data.  
  
  
The R script can be run in R/RStudio when all the files contained in the folder 'data'  
are in the working directory, this script will produce the 'complete' and 'summary'  
datasets and save both of them as comma-separated text files in working directory.
